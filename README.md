# A repo about visualization style


## Requirements

- pyenv
- python==3.9.8

## Setup



```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

*Note: In rare case such a requirements file created with `pip freeze` might not ensure that another (especially M1 chip) user can install and execute it properly. This can happen if libraries need to be compiled (e.g. SciPy). Then it also depends on environment variables and the actual system libraries.*

### Unit testing (Optional)

If you write python scripts for your data processing methods, you can also write unit tests. In order to run the tests execute in terminal:

```bash
pytest
```

This command will execute all the functions in your project that start with the word **test**.
